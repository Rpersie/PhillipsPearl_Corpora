The IPA encoding used here has been derived from a previous encoding (whose description is below), with some characters modified in order  to better match the system described by KLATTESE, used for the English corpus. All phones are described by a single character with the exception of 'ng' used to represent engma.

From previous encoding description:

When creating this transcription key, I've attempted to match the symobls used by 
Brent and Cartwright (1996) for segments that have English equivalents; however,
some symbols (such as N) have been altered.  Diphthongs and affricates rendered
with a single character. The engma is, however, two symbols "ng".  No contrast is
made between long "a umlaut" and long "e", although some dialects do distinguish
their pronunciation.
