GERMAN CORPUS
-------------
Our German corpus is derived from the Caroline corpus, available on CHILDES at http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/data/Germanic/German/Caroline.zip

The corpus follows a single child from age 0;10 to 4;3

Syllabification was done in the following fashion:
    1) If syllabification existed from the CELEX2 database (https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC96L14), it was used
    2) Otherwise, syllabification was done using the Maximimum-Onset Principle

Due to licensing, we're unable to provide the appropriate files for syllabification. The 'syllabify_corpus.pl' script will not function properly without it.

A description of the phonetic encoding into ASCII can be found in the file 'transliteration.key'
