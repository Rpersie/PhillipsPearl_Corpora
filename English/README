ENGLISH CORPUS
--------------
Our English corpus is derived from the Brent corpus, available at http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/data/Eng-NA-MOR/Brent.zip

Specifically, this is an updated version of the UCI Brent Syllables corpus, available at http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/derived/uci_brent_syl.zip

The corpus consists only of child-directed speech where the child was 9 months-of-age or younger. This results in a total of 28,371 utterances.

Syllabification was done in a three step process:
    1) Syllabification was taken from the MRC Psycholinguistics Database, http://ota.oucs.ox.ac.uk/headers/1054.xml
    2) If not found there, syllabification was taken from the English CALLHOME Lexicon, https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC97L20
    3) If not found there, syllabification was done using the Maximum-Onset Principle

Due to licensing, we are unable to provide the relevant files from the English CALLHOME Lexicon. Without those files, the scripts for syllabification will not function properly. 'dict-Brent.txt' was generated from the CALLHOME lexicon by picking out items that appeared in the Brent corpus.

Phonetic encoding into ASCII was done using Klattese, a description of which can be found here: http://www.people.ku.edu/~mvitevit/Klatt_IPA.pdf
