Scripts for English Syllable Conversion
---------------------------------------
Original corpus adapted from the Brent corpus on CHILDES

To run syllabification, from the folder /CrossLing_Corpora/ run the file "generate_corpora.pl"

This will generate the Unicode file that you need, English-uni.txt, an IPA version (encoded in Klattese) is produced, English-phon.txt, as well as a syllabified version of the phonetic corpus, English-syl.txt

Phonetic encoding is done in Klattese. A reference can be found online at http://www.people.ku.edu/~mvitevit/Klatt_IPA.pdf
