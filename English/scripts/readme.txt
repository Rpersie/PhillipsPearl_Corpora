Scripts for English Syllable Conversion
---------------------------------------
Original corpus adapted from the Brent corpus on CHILDES

To run syllabification, open the terminal from the folder /CrossLing_Corpora/English/ and enter the command:

>	perl run-syllabification.pl

This will generate the Unicode file that you need, English-uni.txt, an IPA version (encoded in Klattese) is produced, English-phon.txt, as well as a syllabified version English-syl.txt

Klattese reference can be found online at http://www.people.ku.edu/~mvitevit/Klatt_IPA.pdf
