SPANISH CORPUS
--------------
Our Spanish corpus is derived from the Jackson-Thal corpus on CHILDES, http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/data/Romance/Spanish/JacksonThal.zip

We restricted our corpus to speech directed at children 20 months-of-age or younger. This produces a corpus of 9026 utterances.

Converting the orthographic corpus to a phonetic form was done using the Spanish Callhome lexicon. Due to licensing, we cannot provide the relevant files here.

Syllabification was accomplished using the Maximum-Onset Principle.
